%% Grain Reconstruction
%
%%
% By grain reconstruction we mean the subdivision of the specimen, or more
% precisely the measured surface of the specimen, into regions of similar
% orientation which we then call grains. Note that there is no canonical
% definition of what is a grain. The grain reconstruction method that is
% default in MTEX is based on the definition of high angle grain boundaries
% which are assumed at the Mittelsenkrechten between neighbouring
% measurements whenever their misorientation angle exceeds a certain
% threshold. According to this point of view grains are regions surrounded
% by grain boundaries. 
%
% In order to illustrate the grain reconstruction process we consider the
% following sample data set

close all; plotx2east

% import the data
mtexdata forsterite

% restrict it to a subregion of interest.
ebsd = ebsd(inpolygon(ebsd,[5 2 10 5]*10^3));

% make a phase plot
plot(ebsd)

%% Basic grain reconstruction
%
% We see that there are a lot of not indexed measurements. For grain
% reconstruction, we have  three different choices how to deal with these
% unindexed regions:
%
% # leave them unindexed
% # assign them to the surrounding grains
% # a mixture of both, e.g., assign small notindexed regions to the
% surrounding grains but keep large notindexed regions
%
% By default, MTEX uses the first method. 
%
% The second parameter that is involved in grain reconstruction is the
% threshold misorientation angle indicating a grain boundary. By default,
% this value is set to 10 degrees. 
%
% All grain reconstruction methods in MTEX are accessible via the command 
% <EBSD.calcGrains.html calcGrains> which takes as input an EBSD data set
% and returns a list of grain.

grains = calcGrains(ebsd,'angle',10*degree)

%%
% The reconstructed grains are stored in the variable |grains|.
% Note that also the notIndexed measurements are grouped into grains. This
% allows later to analyze the shape of these unindexed regions.
%
% To visualize the grains we can plot its boundaries by the command
% <grainBoundary.plot.html |plot|>.

% start overide mode
hold on

% plot the boundary of all grains
plot(grains.boundary,'linewidth',1.5)

% stop overide mode
hold off

%% Filling notindexed holes
%
% It is important to understand that MTEX distinguishes the following two
% situations
%
% # a location is marked as notindexed
% # a location does not occur in the data set
%
% A location marked as *notindexed* is interpreted by MTEX as at this
% position, there is *no crystal*, whereas for a location that does not
% occur in the data set is interpreted by MTEX as: it is not known whether
% there is a crystal or not. Just to remind you, the later assumption is
% nothing special as it applies at all locations but the measurement
% points.
%
% A location that does not occur in the data is assigned in MTEX to the
% same grain and phase as the closest measurement point - this may also be
% a notindexed point. Hence, filling holes in MTEX means to erase them
% from the list of measurements, i.e., instead of telling MTEX there is
% no crystal we are telling MTEX: we do not know what there is.

%%
% The extremal case is to say whenever there is a not indexed measurement we
% actually do not know anything and allow MTEX to freely guess what happens
% there. This is realized by removing all not indexed measurements or,
% equivalently, computing the grains only from the indexed measurements

% compute the grains from the indexed measurements only
grains = calcGrains(ebsd('indexed'))

% We observe, especially in the marked grains, how MTEX fills notindexed
% regions and connects otherwise separate measurements to grains. As all
% information about not indexed regions were removed the reconstructed
% grains fill the map completely

%%
% Inside of grain B, there is a large not indexed region and we might argue
% that is not very meaningful to assign such a large region to some grain
% but should have kept it not indexed. In order to decide which not indexed
% region is large enough to be kept not indexed and which not indexed
% regions can be filled it is helpful to know that the command calcGrains
% also separates the not indexed regions into "grains" and we can standard
% grain functions like area or perimeter to analyze these regions.
